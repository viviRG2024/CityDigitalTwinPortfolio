| Introduction of CDE            | General introduction or features                       | Starting from 2013, the city deployed a connected data environment as the backbone of the new operational control system for projects, creating a solid framework for document management, efficient information sharing, and work collaboration across project teams. Then, in 2016, they continued their mission to become a model digital city by producing a 3D representation of the city to improve Helsinki’s internal services and processes, promote smart city development, and share city models as open data to citizens and companies for research and development. |

IoT architecture can consist of three layers - a sensing layer, network layer and application layer. The SSAIM represented the application layer which enabled, algorithms to model the real-time or near time hydraulic performance of a sewerage network. The sensing layer consisted of water level, water velocity, water quality sensors and precipitation gauges which used wireless telemetry to communicate to a web-based cloud server.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The blueprint includes the neighbourhood’s infrastructure, such as roads, waste containers, GSM zones, parking signs, parking lots, public lighting, sofas, pavement, gutters, and green spaces like trees and flower bulbs. Autodesk Revit and SketchUp were also used to create 3D content, including façades and building corridors, that was of insufficient quality for pedestrian viewing in the 3DNL dataset due to anomalous elevations sometimes occurring during LiDAR scanning. |

The LOD of the school model is high enough for facility and asset management uses, including but not limited to plan data, building spaces, equipment, workforces etc. |

The block covered an area of 1.5 km×1.5 km and was executed on July 6, 2018 with favourable weather conditions. A DJI S1000 UAV equipped with 5 SONYILCE-5100 camera lenses was arranged for this flight plan and employed along and across overlaps of 80% and 60%, respectively, to compensate for aircraft instability. Ground truth data surveyed with a real-time kinematic (RTK) system with a mean 3D accuracy of 0.05m were provided in the form of 10 independent check points. To generate the 2D terrain, 10,000 points were converted from the digital city geometry to characterize uneven terrain and other surface features, and at most 3080 points can be extracted from the standard 30-m DEM. |

|                                | For common data models (CDMs)                          | Conceptual Data Model (CDM) based on an extension of CityGML, was proposed for the management of cadastral information in Morocco. Accordingly, a Cadastre Data Model was established, which described different parts of the building units (objects, elements, attributes, and constraints). Some additional classes should be linked to CityGML to model the legal ownership and the administrative operations, including classes of legal object, cadastral object, parcel, property holder, property title, cadastral mark. |
