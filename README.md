| Introduction of CDE            | General introduction or features                       | Starting from 2013, the city deployed a connected data environment as the backbone of the new operational control system for projects, creating a solid framework for document management, efficient information sharing, and work collaboration across project teams. Then, in 2016, they continued their mission to become a model digital city by producing a 3D representation of the city to improve Helsinki’s internal services and processes, promote smart city development, and share city models as open data to citizens and companies for research and development. |
