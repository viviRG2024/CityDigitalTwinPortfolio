| Introduction of CDE            | General introduction or features                       | Starting from 2013, the city deployed a connected data environment as the backbone of the new operational control system for projects, creating a solid framework for document management, efficient information sharing, and work collaboration across project teams.

The blueprint includes the neighbourhood’s infrastructure, such as roads, waste containers, GSM zones, parking signs, parking lots, public lighting, sofas, pavement, gutters, and green spaces like trees and flower bulbs. Autodesk Revit and SketchUp were also used to create 3D content, including façades and building corridors, that was of insufficient quality for pedestrian viewing in the 3DNL dataset due to anomalous elevations sometimes occurring during LiDAR scanning. |

Tasks include the movement, tracking and positioning of forklifts and freights, as well as the inventories of goods, orders of loading and unloading of ships. This could also mean identifying specific activities, like using cranes and moving larger loads, as with a “high risk” flagging. The detailed view of everything happening at the port allows the AI engine to provide feedback on processes and share live updates with port supervisors.Also, the digital twin should be used to train port's personnel. |

| Introduction of CDE            | General introduction or features                       | The USC Facility Managemetn Services (FMS) BIM Guidelines demonstrate an attention to detail that is important with integrating BIM procedures not only into the design and construction of new buildings, but also facilities management and operations. Data requirements (for data sources and CDMs) and executive plans were included, such as (1) Appendix B: BIM Data Acquisition Guideline for Facilities Management Services describes how the facilities data in general terms should be extracted from the BIM. This includes directions for applying shared parameters, lists space management objectives, and describes COBie standard worksheets. (2) Appendix G: USC FMS Outline Schedule Data Specification lists database field requirements for numerous schedules: Sump pump, hot water generator, fixture, pump, fan, air terminal unit, re-heat coil, diffuser/register, sound attenuator, air handling unit, computer room air conditioning units, fan coil units, radiant panel, electrical panel, and lighting fixture. (3) Appendix H: EcoDomus describes the process used for implementing EcoDomus on USC projects. It consists of five steps: Configuring the COBie quality control template, populating the equipment database, loading the as-built building information model into EcoDomus, performing COBie quality control, and updating the Revit model with the verified data |

The LOD of the school model is high enough for facility and asset management uses, including but not limited to plan data, building spaces, equipment, workforces etc. |

The data registration contains two steps: First, users can register a data source in the UADI by providing a WFS GetCapabilities query URL, the system will fetch all available data layer schemas from the data source so that users can choose and activate any data layers in the UADI. For each data layer, metadata including title, abstract, keywords, geographic extent, coordinate reference system (CRS), attribute names are automatically harvested from the WFS query and can be further edited manually. Besides, UADI also demands detailed metadata for each attribute including description, data type, statistical type etc. Attribute level metadata is critical for understanding the data structure and hence assisting in the semantic enrichment process. |

This step involves aligning and harmonizing data to ensure compatibility and consistency.(3) Parameterization: CityEngine allows users to define parameters and rules that govern the generation of urban environments. These parameters could include building heights, setback distances, road widths, and more. By setting these parameters based on the input data, the model could accurately reflect the characteristics of the real urban environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

In the webpage, the user may select the orchard (Iab), click on the Submit button below, select the fifth tree (Iab-5), and click on the Submit button below. After the submission, there are nine panels shown:Map, Soil,Weather, Agricultural Practice, Sugar Content Distribution, Fruit Size Distribution, Sugar Content History, and Fruit Size History. TheMap panel presents the location of the Iab orchard in Jeju Island. The Soil panel presents the percentile of each soil component (available phosphate, exchangeable potassium, exchangeable calcium, exchangeablemagnesium, soil acidity, organic matter, electric conductivity) compared to other areas in the island. It also shows whether the observed level is within the RDA recommendation or not. The Weather panel presents the percentile of temperature, humidity, and air pressure compared to other areas in the island. The Agricultural Practice panel compares the five agricultural practices (fertilization, mulching, spraying, pruning, and thinning) to other orchards in the island. The Sugar Content Distribution and Fruit Size Distribution compare the sugar content and fruit size, respectively. In each panel, the Iab orchard is compared to other orchards in the island, and the Iab-5 tree is compared to other trees in the Iab orchard. The Sugar Content History and Fruit Size History show the weekly patterns of sugar content and fruit size, respectively, at orchard-level and tree-level. The DT will show that the average sugar content and fruit size increases and decreases, respectively, with respect to time at both orchard-level (Iab) and tree-level (Iab-5). |

(3) The 3D hydrodynamic model was based on the 3D Reynoldsaveraged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations with the non-hydrostatic pressure approximation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                | Geometric data collection method                       | A multi-camera system equipped on an UAV that captures oblique images in different directions serves as a dataset acquisition tool. The block covered an area of 1.5 km×1.5 km and was executed on July 6, 2018 with favourable weather conditions. A DJI S1000 UAV equipped with 5 SONYILCE-5100 camera lenses was arranged for this flight plan and employed along and across overlaps of 80% and 60%, respectively, to compensate for aircraft instability. Ground truth data surveyed with a real-time kinematic (RTK) system with a mean 3D accuracy of 0.05m were provided in the form of 10 independent check points. To generate the 2D terrain, 10,000 points were converted from the digital city geometry to characterize uneven terrain and other surface features, and at most 3080 points can be extracted from the standard 30-m DEM. |

|                                | Geometric data collection method                       | Trimble X7 played a pivotal role in conducting the 3D laser scanning, while the collection of roof point cloud data was achieved through oblique photography techniques. Subsequently, the Geomagic studio software was used to process the generated point cloud model. Lastly, the fusion of Trimble Realworks (point cloud model) and Trimble Sketchup (widely used digital model software) facilitated the translation of mapping data and culminating in comprehensive 3D inverse modeling. With the support of field investigations, the ultimate BIM model was built, capturing pertinent details of various components and recording them within Revit. |

|                                | For common data models (CDMs)                          | Conceptual Data Model (CDM) based on an extension of CityGML, was proposed for the management of cadastral information in Morocco. Accordingly, a Cadastre Data Model was established, which described different parts of the building units (objects, elements, attributes, and constraints). Some additional classes should be linked to CityGML to model the legal ownership and the administrative operations, including classes of legal object, cadastral object, parcel, property holder, property title, cadastral mark. |
